## *Entry 002: A Mysterious Signal*  
### Something strange happened today. While scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life, I intercepted a faint signal. The pattern was irregular, almost like a message. I tried to trace its origin, but the signal disappeared before I could get a fix on it. 

### Could it be another explorer, or something... more? The thought of contacting another being—perhaps a new species, or even just another lonely traveler—fills me with both excitement and fear. What if they’re not friendly? What if they’re like us?

### I’ll continue the search. Space is vast, but it’s never truly empty. There’s always something lurking, waiting to be discovered.
