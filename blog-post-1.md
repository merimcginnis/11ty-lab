# Entry 001
## *Entry 001: Aboard the Starship*
### I have left Earth behind, alone in the vastness of the galaxy. The stars are so much farther away than I ever imagined. Every light I see is a reminder of the planets and civilizations that have existed for millennia. 

### Today, I passed a nebula that lit up the entire view screen, its swirling gases glowing in hues of pink and blue. It’s hard to comprehend the scale of what I’m experiencing. The loneliness is overwhelming, yet strangely comforting. The silence of space has a beauty of its own.

### I wonder if anyone will ever read these logs. Will they wonder what became of me when my mission is done? Or will I fade into the silence, like so many before me?
